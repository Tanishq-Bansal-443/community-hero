## 🌍 Project Overview

### The Problem
Traditional civic reporting systems are broken: manual routing, subjective prioritization, bureaucratic bottlenecks, and "black-hole" feedback loops where citizens never hear back about their complaints. This leads to frustrated citizens, wasted municipal resources, and deteriorating infrastructure.

### The Community Hero Solution
**Community Hero** is an AI-powered civic issue management platform that enables citizens to report local infrastructure problems using images. Google Gemini automatically classifies issues, estimates severity, and assists authorities by verifying repair evidence through before-and-after image comparison — bringing transparency, speed, and intelligence to civic issue resolution.

## 🏆 Hackathon Requirements (Judges' Guide)

<details open>
<summary><b>Click to expand Hackathon Details</b></summary>

| Criteria | Implementation in Community Hero |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Problem Statement** | Community Hero – Hyperlocal Problem Solver. Empowers citizens to instantly report and track local civic issues while equipping authorities with an AI-assisted review and verification dashboard. |
| **Theme Alignment** | AI for Smart Cities. Integrates Gemini directly into the civic issue lifecycle — from detection to repair verification — to create transparent, self-organizing urban maintenance workflows. |
| **Solution Overview** | An end-to-end platform bridging citizens and authorities via AI-powered classification, severity estimation, duplicate detection, community validation, and repair verification. |
| **Impact & Community Benefits** | Reduces issue triage time from days to seconds. Promotes civic engagement through real-time tracking and community validation. Helps authorities detect fraudulent repair claims. |
| **Innovation & AI Capabilities** | Multimodal image-based issue detection, AI-driven severity scoring, smart duplicate merging within a 100m radius, and AI-powered before/after repair verification with re-verification workflows. |

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 AI & Automation
- **AI Issue Detection** — Google Gemini automatically detects civic issues from uploaded images, identifying type (Pothole, Garbage, Streetlight, Water Logging, Sewage) and estimating severity (Low, Medium, High, Severe).
- **AI Repair Verification** — Compares before-and-after images to verify completed repairs and flag potentially fraudulent submissions.
- **Re-Verification Workflow** — Disputed repairs can be resubmitted with new evidence for another round of AI verification.
- **Smart Duplicate Detection** — Automatically merges reports within a 100m radius to prevent duplicate complaints and spam.

### 🏙️ Civic & Authority Tools
- **Community Validation** — Citizens can confirm they're affected by an issue; higher validation increases its priority.
- **Interactive Issue Map** — Live emoji markers (🕳️🗑️💡💧🤢) with marker size scaling dynamically by affected citizen count.
- **Citizen Dashboard** — Nearby issues, live statistics, filtering & sorting, and an interactive map view.
- **Authority Dashboard** — Incident management, AI insights, fraud detection, and repair verification in one place.
- **Real-Time Synchronization** — Firestore `onSnapshot` keeps all devices updated instantly.

### 🎨 UI / UX
- **Responsive Design** — Consistent experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Role-Based Access** — Separate, tailored experiences for Citizens and Authorities.

## ⚡ Google Technologies Utilized

| Technology | Purpose in Community Hero |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Gemini API** | The core brain — multimodal image analysis for issue detection, severity scoring, and before/after repair verification. |
| **Firebase Firestore** | Real-time NoSQL database powering live issue updates across citizen and authority dashboards. |
| **Firebase Authentication** | Secure, role-based authentication for citizens and authorities. |
| **Firebase App Hosting (Cloud Run)** | Serverless deployment of the Next.js application with automatic scaling. |
| **Google AI Studio** | Used to prototype and validate Gemini prompts and structured JSON output schemas before backend integration. |
